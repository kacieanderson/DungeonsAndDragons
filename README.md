# DungeonsAndDragons 

In the past, Dungeons and Dragons players had to keep track of all their information by hand-writing it. Recently, some popular mobile applications have come into existence to ease this pain, but these are generally poorly designed and difficult to use. They are also not very informative for first-time players in terms of how to create a new character.

I have created an application using JavaFX that guides users through creating a DnD 5e character from scratch, and then keeps track of their character information and statistics for a “one-shot” game of DnD. 

There is also an option for the user to “roll dice.” There are seven unique die that can be rolled in DnD, and my application offers the option to randomly generate numbers appropriate for these respective die for users who do not have any of the physical ones to use.
