DnDGUI.AScoreDescription=Every character in the game has capabilities defined by six ability scores. These scores, and the ability modifiers derived from them, are the basis for determining whether your character succeeds or fails to perform certain actions. The scores are randomly generated bewteen 3 and 20. Feel free to keep randomizing until you see the scores you like.
DnDGUI.DescribeDwarves=Dwarves are a stoic but stern race, ensconced in cities carved from the hearts of mountains. More than any other race, dwarves have acquired a reputation as dour and humorless artisans of the earth. They benefit from increased Constitution scores.
DnDGUI.DescribeElves=Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires. Elves love nature and magic, art, music and poetry, and the good things of the world. They benefit from increased Dexterity scores.
DnDGUI.DescribeHalflings=The comforts of home are the goals of most Halflings lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. They benefit from increased Dexterity scores.
DnDGUI.DescribeHumans=In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the youngest of the common races. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given.
DnDGUI.DescribeDragonborns=Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the Dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. They benefit from increased Strength and Charisma scores.
DnDGUI.DescribeGnomes=A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens where gnomes form their closeknit communities. They take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, investigation, creation, and play. They benefit from increased Intelligence scores.
DnDGUI.DescribeHalfelves=Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves. They benefit from increased Charisma scores.
DnDGUI.DescribeHalforcs= Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races. They benefit from increased Strength and Constitution scores.
DnDGUI.DescribeTieflings=To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence on the street, to see mistrust in every eye: this is the lot of the Tiefling. This is because a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeus (overlord of the Nine Hells) into Tieflings' bloodlines. They benefit from increased Intelligence and Charisma scores.
DnDGUI.AlignmentDescription=Each character has an alignment, which broadly describes their moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral).
DnDGUI.DescribeBarbarians=Barbarians are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.
DnDGUI.DescribeBards=Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a bard weaves magic through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds.
DnDGUI.DescribeClerics=Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. 
DnDGUI.DescribeDruids=Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will.
DnDGUI.DescribeFighters=Fighters have an unparalleled mastery of weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both doling it out and staring it defiantly in the face.
DnDGUI.DescribeMonks=Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.
DnDGUI.DescribePaladins=A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk.
DnDGUI.DescribeRangers=Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization: humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons.
DnDGUI.DescribeRogues=Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes' weaknesses to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.
DnDGUI.DescribeSorcerers=Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces.
DnDGUI.DescribeWarlocks=Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and spectacular.
DnDGUI.DescribeWizards=Wizards are supreme magic users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control.
